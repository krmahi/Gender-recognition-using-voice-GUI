# voice_recognition_using_voice
Recognizing the speaker's gender is useful in automatic salutations, tagging audio recordings, seperating sounds belonging to a specific gender for analysis, etc. that can help digital personal assistants in reproducing male, female generic results.  
```
This Project contains the dataset of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers.  
The voice samples are pre-processed by acoustic analysis in R using the seewave and tuneR packages,  
with an analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz (human vocal range).
```
  
 ## VOICE ATTRIBUTES  
 
Each voice sample format is a .WAV file. The .WAV format 
files have been pre-processed for acoustic analysis using the 
specan function by the WarbleR R package 
The pre-processed WAV files have been saved into a CSV 
file. The CSV file is contained 3168 rows and 21 columns. 
There are features and the classification of male or female in
